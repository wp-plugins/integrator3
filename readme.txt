Take integration-on-demand to a whole new level with Integrator 3 - bringing together so much without sacrificing functionality and usability.

== Description ==

= Single Point Integration =

Integrator 3 provides several options for integrating your web site applications.  Joomla, Wordpress, Kayako Fusion and WHMCS can all be integrated through a single point, providing reliable, consistant and clear integration between the various frameworks. 

The visual integration between your CMS and applications permits you to update the look of one without worrying about breaking the other.  With Integrator 3, you can create pages in your CMS that get pulled and wrapped around your applications, allowing you to create custom pages and content displayed for any individual page on your application.

The user integration works as a single location to sign-on to your site and for your clients to manage their information in one place.  In addition, you can change individual accounts in any application without breaking the integration.

Providing a single point for your applications permits you to focus on the more important aspect of your business: your customers.

= Integrated Registration =

Provide a single location for registering on your entire site with Integrator 3!  I3 intelligently knows which fields your applications need to fully register a user and requests those fields one time, reducing redundant field entry and providing a streamlined and clean registration process for your users.

Integrator 3 also permits you to ask for fields in any order you desire, and includes the optional use of password strength checking and reCaptcha to ensure valid user entries.  On top of that, I3 will check on the fly against all your applications for any usernames or email addresses that may be in use to avoid user conflicts.

Best of all, I3 doesn't require matching or hard code bridging your users across various databases and permits your various applications to do their own account management and checking; Integrator 3 stays out of the way as much as possible.

= Expandable and Dynamic =

With Integrator 3, the possibilities don't end!  Add Kayako Fusion or WHMCS at any time after you setup your web site with ease.  Multiple interfaces to the same Support front end?  No problem; Integrator 3 can allow you to use any number of Joomla or Wordpress CMS installations to tie into the same WHMCS or Kayako Fusion interface.

Integrator 3 was designed with the future in mind.  Additional connection types are on the drawing board to permit you to take advantage of even more applications and features on your web site.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= How is Integrator 3 different from J!WHMCS Integrator? Don't they do the same thing? =

Integrator 3 is a separate, stand-alone product which does not rely upon having either Joomla! or WHMCS. Integrator 3 is designed from the ground up to provide the most dynamic, secure and stable application integration available. While J!WHMCS Integrator has been implemented to wrap WHMCS with Joomla!, Integrator 3 offers the possibility of wrapping WHMCS and Kayako Fusion with Joomla! or Wordpress with the exciting possibilities of adding even more connection types such as Drupal or even vBulletin.

We believe the visual integration alone is worth taking a closer look at Integrator 3, but Integrator 3 also bridges users between connected applications and also provides the ability to have one all inclusive registration form.

= How many connections can I have? =

The beauty of Integrator 3 is that it provides the capability to have an unlimited number of connections to different applications and CMS sites.  This permits you to for instance wrap the same install of WHMCS with multiple Joomla sites or WordPress sites.

By default, your license will include either 2 connections (Lite licenses) or 3 connections (standard licenses), with additional connections at $100 each.

The possible connections are amazing:

Lite License
* Joomla - WHMCS, * Joomla - Kayako Fusion, * Wordpress - WHMCS, * Wordpress - Kayako Fusion

Standard License
* Joomla - Joomla - WHMCS, * Joomla - Wordpress - WHMCS, * Wordpress - Wordpress - WHMCS, * Joomla - Joomla - Kayako Fusion, * Joomla - Wordpress - Kayako Fusion, * Wordpress - Wordpress - Kayako Fusion, * Joomla - WHMCS - Kayako Fusion (like Go Higher!), * Wordpress - WHMCS - Kayakko Fusion
